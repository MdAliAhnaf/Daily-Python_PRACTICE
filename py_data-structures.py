# <<LIST>>
#items are stored sequentially
#Lists are mutable
#can hold on to different data types

list = ['hi' , 'bye' , 0, 9]

print(list)

# <<TUPLE>>
#ordered list of values
#immutable
#in many ways, it is simillar to a list; one of the most important difference is that tuples can be used as KEYs in a dictionary or elements of a SET.
